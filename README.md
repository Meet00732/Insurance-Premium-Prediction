# Insurance Premium Prediction

## Overview
This project presents a robust and scalable pipeline designed for processing insurance data, covering stages from data ingestion to model deployment. It's crafted to meet industry standards, ensuring modularity, configurability, and automation. This pipeline facilitates tasks such as policy pricing, leveraging machine learning for predictive analytics.

## Components
- **Data Ingestion**: Importing raw data for processing.
- **Data Validation**: Ensuring data quality and consistency.
- **Data Transformation**: Preparing data for modeling.
- **Model Training**: Building predictive models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance.
- **Model Deployment**: Deploying models for predictions.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required Python libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, streamlit (Refer to `requirements.txt` for details).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Launch the application with: `streamlit run app.py`

### Running the Pipeline
To run the pipeline, execute the following command: `python main.py`
This command orchestrates the entire process, from data ingestion to model evaluation.

### Launch Application
- After executing command `python main.py`, to create the application using streamlit run: `streamlit run app.py`
