# Insurance Data Processing Pipeline

## Overview
This project develops a comprehensive data processing pipeline specifically designed for handling insurance data. It integrates multiple stages from data ingestion to model deployment, ensuring a seamless workflow for transforming raw data into actionable insights.

## Components
### Data Ingestion: Automates the retrieval of data from various sources.
Data Validation: Checks data quality and adherence to predefined standards.
### Data Transformation: Prepares data for analysis by cleaning and structuring.
### Model Training: Utilizes processed data to train machine learning models.
### Model Evaluation: Assesses the performance of the models against benchmarks.
### Model Deployment: Makes the model available for generating predictions.

## Technologies
Python: Core programming language
Streamlit: For creating the web application interface
Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation and numerical analysis
Scikit-Learn: Machine learning algorithms

## Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit application: streamlit run app.py

## Usage
Configure the config.yaml file according to your data and model preferences.
Execute the main.py script to run the entire pipeline.
Access the Streamlit web application for interactive data exploration and predictions.
